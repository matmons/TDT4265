    "On a general level, implementing the various \"tricks of the trade\" improves the accuracy and convergence speed. As the improved sigmoid depends on zero-centered input, improved weight initialization was implemented first. The network with improved weights achieves a much higher validation accuracy in a shorter time (in epochs) compared to its \"default\" counterpart. \n",

The validation accuracy flattens, but minor validation accuracy improvements are continously made. This is only a minor case and we do not see it as significant.\n",
