    "\n",
    "#### Agumentation\n",
    "We tried applying three different augmentation methods, a random horizontal flip, rotation, and crop. We tried each alone first and then all together to see if they improved the network. The horizontal flip increased the networkâ€™s test accuracy to 0.769, rotation increased test accuracy to 0.739 and crop increased the network to 0.74. While adding them all together at the same time increased the accuracy to 0.752. We see that horizontal flip gave the largest increase alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Argumentation is used for extending your dataset by creating altered versions of the same image, resulting in more images to train on and therefore giving an increase in accuracy. The altered versions also give the classifier a wider variety to train on and therefore making the network more robust, it has a regularizing effect. There are many different transformations one can implement, but adding too many can distort the images too much and make it harder for the model to learn. This can be the reason that horizontal flip gives better accuracy alone, compared to all of them implemented at the same time. One also has to consider which transformation is logical to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regularization by Dropout\n",
    "By applying dropout we increase the test accuracy by 6.0% and achieved 76.4% accuracy. We tried to use both p=0.2, 20%, for each dropout layer, and an increase of 10% for each dropout, therefore a harder dropout. A consistent dropout percentage of 20% gave the best results. Dropout regularization the network, and makes it less prone to overfitting. It does this by reducing its parameters by randomly drop out nodes along with their connection. Thereby the remaining nodes must adapt, and this is the reason why we see an increase in accuracy. The reason a dropout of 20% gave better results can be because of the number of parameters in the network and how deep it is, in a network with more layers and therefore more parameters it would probably give better results with a harder dropout.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch normalization\n",
    "We can see with batch normalization the network train faster, we achieve the same accuracy earlier in the training. Compared to the model in task 2, which achieved a test accuracy at 70.4% with 5 epochs, we achieved the same accuracy after 2 epochs with normalization and ended up with a final test accuracy at 74.3%. This is an improvement by 3.9%. This is because normalization normalizes the activation of the previous layer at each batch, maintaining the activation mean close to 0 and standard deviation close to 1. Therefore addresses the problem of internal covariance shift, and with this, it stabilizes the learning and accelerates the learning process. It also acts as a regularizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kernel size 3x3\n",
    "Changing the kernel size to 3x3 and padding to 1 did not give a significant improvement. The test accuracy with kernel size 3x3 was 70.5%, therefore only a 1% increase. Using a larger kernel size (5x5) can result in losing detail in some smaller features, that a smaller kernel size would be able to detect better. On the other hand, a kernel with size 5x5 is expected to be able to detect bigger details that a 3x3 kernel might miss. The images in CIFAR10 have a low resolution and differ in the degree of detail. We believe that kernel size of 3x3 is better for classifying some of the images while 5x5 is better for the others, and in this case, it was more important with a number of layers than the kernel size. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LeakyRelu activation\n",
    "Applying LeakyRelu with a=0.01 to the network achieved a test accuracy at 74.3%. The ReLU activation function can cause some weights not to be updated during backpropagation since not all of the neurons activate and therefore leaving the gradient to be zero. This can lead to a neuron not activate on any datapoint again, thereby \"die\". Using the LeakyReLU activation function we address this problem, by returning a very small value instead of zero, when x is negative, therefore result in better accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying a deeper network \n",
    "Containing the same network architecture as task 2, but applying additional layers with the same structure. By adding one more layer we achieved a test accuracy of 73% and adding two layers resulted in a test accuracy of 75.1%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also tried to change the architecture structure to (conv-relu-conv-relu-pool)xN â†’ (affine)xM â†’ softmax, with the same amount of layers as the model in network 1 in task 3a. This gave an increase in test accuracy at 9.2%, resulting in a accuracy at 79.6%, and therefore the technique that we saw the largest amount of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of deeper networks is that they can learn features at various levels of abstraction, whereas shallow networks are not able to learn as well. Training a network to classify more complex images require a more complex network that adds non-linearity to the model which a deeper CNN provides. This can clearly be seen in the increase of accuracy when applying more layers. \n",
